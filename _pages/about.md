Quanling Deng was born in Hunan, China. He moved to the USA to study mathematics in August 2011 and graduated with a Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Wyoming in May 2016. In October 2016, he joined Curtin University as a **research associate** at the Department of Applied Geology. He became an affiliated member of Curtin Institute for Computation and Curtin TIGeR. He was a **visiting scholar** at INRIA (Paris France, 5-6/2019), AGH University of Science and Technology (Krakow Poland, 6-7/2018, 5/2019), Ã‰cole des Ponts ParisTech (ENPC, Paris France, 5-6/2017), and others. He joined the Department of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as a **Van Vleck visiting assistant professor**  on March 12, 2020 (right before the university lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic).


# What am I doing recently?

* SeaIce-Atmosphere Modeling (SIAM)

  - This following video shows the evolution of the sea ice floes when taking the atmosphere impact into consideration (the wind velocity is of scale 10m/s)

* Ocean-SeaIce-Atmosphere Modeling (OSIAM)

  - This following video shows the evolution of the sea ice floes when taking the atmosphere and ocean impact into consideration (the wind velocity is of scale 10m/s; the ocean velocity is of scale 1m/s; the simulation domain is 100km x 100km; the simulation final time is about 27 hours)
