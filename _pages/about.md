Kangqi Fu was born in Beijing, China. He moved to the United States to study physics, applied and computational Math, and computer science in August 2018 and will graduate with a BS in AMEP (Applied Math, Physics, and Engineering) and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin Madison in May 2021. He enjoys coding and problem-solving in general. When he is not working, he usually plays video games and makes beats with his friends. His CV can be downloaded [here](https://kennykangmpc.github.io/Kangqi.github.io/files/KangqiCV2.pdf).


# Projects
* SeaIce Modeling
  - This following video shows the sea ice motion with subfloes generation. More process including fracturing, riding, packing will be updated soon. Current codes can be found [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/JuliaIceFloe)

* Deep Learning Sea Ice Tracking
  - Codes can be found [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/SeaIceDeepLearning)
  - Keep Updating!
* Coarse Scale Modeling and Conservation Law solver(with cartesian grid implementation)
  - Codes can be found [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/CoarseScale-Solver). Need to be organized.
  - Keep Updating!
* Metasurface-Integrated Buried-Heterostructure Quantum Cascade Lasers for Programmable Directional Lasing Emissions
  - This project is the final project of Physics 625, Advnaced Optics. In this project, my partner, Zerio Liu, and I presented a novel hybird laser system by combining the buried-heterostructure quantum cascade lasers (BH-QCLs) and a diffractive metalens consisting of cylindrical nanorods. This system could be used for programmable directional lasing emissions. The simulation was done by COMSOL and MATLAB. The report can be found [here](https://kennykangmpc.github.io/Kangqi.github.io/files/Physics_625_Final%20Report.pdf).

* Planetary trajectory Optimization
  - This project focused on finding the optimal path a space probe could take while traveling in the inner solar system. The model we created accounts for the gravity that large celestial objects produce, as well as their orbits. The report can be found [here](https://kennykangmpc.github.io/Kangqi.github.io/files/PlanetaryTrajectoryOpt.html)

* Interesting Paper Re-Implementation for Coding Practice 
  - Reimplement Felipe Vico, Leslie Greengard, Miguel Ferrando. "Fast convolution with free-space Green's functions. Journal of computational physics 323 (2016), 191-203. My code for re-implementation work can be found [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/FastConvolutionFSGF)
  - Stay tuned for more!
