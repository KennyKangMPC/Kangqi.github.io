Kangqi Fu was born in Beijing, China. He moved to the United States to study physics, applied and computational Math, and computer science in August 2018 and will graduate with a BS in AMEP (Applied Math, Physics, and Engineering) and Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin Madison in May 2020. He enjoys coding and problem-solving in general. When he is not working, he usually plays video games and makes beats with his friends.

* SeaIce-Atmosphere Modeling (SIAM)

  - This following video shows the evolution of the sea ice floes when taking the atmosphere impact into consideration (the wind velocity is of scale 10m/s)

* Ocean-SeaIce-Atmosphere Modeling (OSIAM)

  - This following video shows the evolution of the sea ice floes when taking the atmosphere and ocean impact into consideration (the wind velocity is of scale 10m/s; the ocean velocity is of scale 1m/s; the simulation domain is 100km x 100km; the simulation final time is about 27 hours)
