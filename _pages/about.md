Kangqi Fu was born in Beijing, China. He moved to the United States to study physics, applied and computational Math, and computer science in August 2018 and will graduate with a BS in [AMEP](https://www.math.wisc.edu/amep) (Applied Math, Physics, and Engineering) and [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin Madison in May 2021. He enjoys coding and problem-solving in general. When he is not working, he usually plays video games and makes beats with his friends. After three years in Madison, in September 2021, he will go to NYC to pursue applied and computational math Ph.D. degree at [Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.courant.nyu.edu/). His CV is [here](https://kennykangmpc.github.io/Kangqi.github.io/files/KangqiCV3.pdf)


# Projects
* Atmosphere Dynamics Modeling. The code is [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/JuliaIceFloe) 

  - This following video shows the evolution of the streamfunction near the earth's surface

* SeaIce-Atmosphere Modeling

  - This following video shows the evolution of the sea ice floes when taking the atmosphere impact into consideration (the wind velocity is of scale 10m/s). The code is [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/JuliaIceFloe)

* Ocean-SeaIce-Atmosphere Modeling

  - This following video shows the evolution of the sea ice floes when taking the atmosphere and ocean impact into consideration (the wind velocity is of scale 10m/s; the ocean velocity is of scale 1m/s; the simulation domain is 100km x 100km; the simulation final time is about 27 hours).The code is [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/JuliaIceFloe)

* SeaIce Modeling
  - This following video shows the sea ice motion with subfloes generation. More process including fracturing, riding, packing will be updated soon. Current code is compiled in Julia and the visualization is done by MATLAB. The code is [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/JuliaIceFloe)

* Deep Learning Sea Ice Tracking
  - Codes can be found [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/SeaIceDeepLearning)
  - Keep Updating!
* Coarse Scale Modeling and Conservation Law solver(with cartesian grid implementation)

  - Codes can be found [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/CoarseScale-Solver). Videos for test cases are below. The first one is a 2D scalar advection equation, the second one is a 2D system of conservation of mass and momentum equations. Another example with irregular domain using cut cell grid will be uploaded soon.

  - Keep Updating!
  
* Metasurface-Integrated Buried-Heterostructure Quantum Cascade Lasers for Programmable Directional Lasing Emissions
  - This project is the final project of Physics 625, Advnaced Optics. In this project, my partner, Zerio Liu, and I presented a novel hybird laser system by combining the buried-heterostructure quantum cascade lasers (BH-QCLs) and a diffractive metalens consisting of cylindrical nanorods. This system could be used for programmable directional lasing emissions. The simulation was done by COMSOL and MATLAB. The report can be found [here](https://kennykangmpc.github.io/Kangqi.github.io/files/Physics_625_Final%20Report.pdf).

* Planetary trajectory Optimization
  - This project focused on finding the optimal path a space probe could take while traveling in the inner solar system. The model we created accounts for the gravity that large celestial objects produce, as well as their orbits. The report can be found [here](https://kennykangmpc.github.io/Kangqi.github.io/files/PlanetaryTrajectoryOpt.html)

* Interesting Paper Re-Implementation for Coding Practice 
  - Reimplement Felipe Vico, Leslie Greengard, Miguel Ferrando. "Fast convolution with free-space Green's functions. Journal of computational physics 323 (2016), 191-203. My code for re-implementation work can be found [here](https://github.com/KennyKangMPC/FastConvolutionFSGF)
